[00:22.62] I'm lost, I'm a ghost
[00:30.12] Dispossessed, taken host
[00:42.12] 
[00:37.45] My hunger burns a bullet hole
[00:44.42] A spectre of my mortal soul
[00:52.06] These rumours and suspicion
[00:59.20] Anger is a poison
[01:07.70] 
[01:06.99] The only truth that I could see
[01:13.75] Is when you put your lips to me
[01:21.08] Future's tricked by the past
[01:28.59] Spectre, how he laughs
[01:39.59] 
[01:59.75] Fear puts a spell on us
[02:07.44] Always second-guessing love
[02:20.94] 
[02:14.54] My hunger burns a bullet hole
[02:21.54] A spectre of my mortal soul
[02:29.24] The only truth that I can see
[02:36.38] Spectre has come for me
