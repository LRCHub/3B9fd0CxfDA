Your soul don't burn
You dark the sun
Rain down fire on everyone
Scabs, police, government thieves
Venal, psychic amputees

Parasitic your syphilitic
Parasitic your syphilitic

Swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
Swastika eyes
Swastika eyes

Vent my spleen
I'll keep my dreams
My flesh, my bones, my soul
I own
My mind's a weapon, immune from infection
Blood in my eyes, my vision is clear

Parasitic your syphilitic
Parasitic your syphilitic

Swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
Swastika eyes
Swastika eyes

I see your
Autosuggestion psychology
Ellimination policy
A military, industrial illusion of democracy

Swastika eyes
Swastika eyes
Swastika eyes
