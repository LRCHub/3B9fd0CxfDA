I never knew what made me do it
I just remember it was wrong
I've questioned why I put you through it
Who would have thought you'd be so strong
I should have wrapped you up and kept you safe
Instead I turned my back on you

Chorus:
You can't deny there's a spectre of love
He keeps the hawk and dove
You can't deny there's a spectre of love

I keep your picture by my window
You're smiling and you look so young
If I could only speak your language
You'd know that you're the only one
I feel like stepping out in dead mans shoes
And only you can save me now

Chorus.

And if the time should give up
This can be undone I swear it

Salvation can be found in times like these
I just need you when I found mine

Chorus.
